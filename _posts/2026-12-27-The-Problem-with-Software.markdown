I've been writing software for almost 20 years, and this year I've become quite active in open-source projects. I'm especially passionate about Haskell because I think it is unusually expressive. This means that I'm active on some Discord servers ([come join us!](https://discord.gg/8u8SCWfrNC)), and I also snoop regularly on the Haskell Reddit. 

I try to be as positive as I can and as helpful as I can. Haskell is not known for being a particularly beginner-friendly language. (Part of it, of course, is the community's own doing; and I think Haskellers, myself included, do enjoy this reputation.) 

But sometimes I see [people trying to help](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1pnl3xw/setup_completely_failing/) and it honestly demoralizes me.

> OP: Setup completely failing... (Describes in detail what they have already done)

> Commenter 1: Go to your teacher.

> Commenter 2: Switch to Linux if possible.

Reading those comments felt particularly triggering to me. It's been a long time since I've had to deal with those comments in a professional capacity (these days, I have the ability to say "thank you but no thank you", and then walk off.) But the commenter was clearly well-motivated, and genuinely seeking help. 

Comments like "go to your teacher" are actively _not_ useful. Comments like "switch to Linux" understate the difficulty of managing multiple OSes on Windows, and seem to be laced with the disapproval of using a Windows setup. Fine, I get it, but we don't know a thing about OP, and laptops are expensive for students. 

I call this kind of help "drive-by helping" - help which is rendered freely, but also... free from context, nuance and understanding of the underlying issue. Imagine if the good Samaritan said to the half-dead Levite, "have you tried pulling yourself up by your bootstraps?"

Writing software is fun, but working with people who write software is fraught.
